# BioHackathon MENA

The BioHackathon MENA is an event that takes place 7-11 February 2023 at KAUST in Saudi Arabia.

## Overview

The BioHackathon is an event to discuss and implement ideas related to the bioinformatics infrastructure in the Middle East and beyond. The topics for the first such hackathon are deliberately broad and can relate to any area of bioinformatics, but we are specifically interested in topics related to Health & Wellbeing, Environment & Sustainable Living, and Biotechnology in the Middle East / North Africa region.

## Aims and Objectives

The aims of the hackathon are to promote the development of Open Source software and infrastructure for data integration, with a specific focus on the MENA region. Potential topics relate to the development of open source software or databases, improving interoperability of databases, developing and applying metadata standards as well as the FAIR principles to existing data resources.

## Registration and funding

Registration to the hackathon is free, and participants are responsible for their own accommodation, transportation, and food expenses. We will support participation of a selected number of participants.
